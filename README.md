# Game Of Life in 3D
C++ rendering of Conway's Game of Life in three dimensions using OpenGL for rendering along with SFML and TGUI for the front-end.
# Platforms
This has been tested and built for Windows 7,8, 8.1 and 10 in both 32 and 64-bit varieties. The solution should be able to be built without issue on both Linux and Mac as well due to all dependencies also being cross-platform.
# About
Developed using Visual Studio 2017, this was my third year University project. This is a reupload of the project.
# Documentation
The project is fully documented through doxygen and can be found [here]. Upsettingly the creation of the documentation was totally pointless, but felt necessary to do.

# Controls
1. Use F1-6 keys to hide and show panels.
2. Esc to access options menu.
3. Middle mouse button to rotate.
4. Press enter with text box selected for the change to take effect
