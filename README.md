# Game Of Life in 3D
C++ simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in three dimensions using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) for rendering along with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) windows and input and the [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) UI library.
# Platforms
This has been tested and built for Windows 7,8, 8.1 and 10 in both 32 and 64-bit varieties. The solution should be able to be built without issue on both Linux and Mac as well due to all dependencies also being cross-platform.
# About
Developed using Visual Studio 2017, this was my third year University project. This is a reupload of the project.
# Documentation
The project is fully documented, ready for web publishing, through [doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/) and is included in the project. Upsettingly the creation of the documentation was ultimately totally pointless, but felt necessary to do.
